# WP Career Board (Free) — Capabilities

Buyer-level rollup of what the Free plugin does. Verified against code on the `1.7.0` branch.
Status legend: `YES` (shipped, code-verified) · `YES·partial` (works with a named limit) ·
`PLANNED` (roadmap/card exists, unbuilt) · `NO` (absent, often by design) · `PRO` (delivered by the Pro plugin).

**Last verified against code: 2026-07-13 (branch 1.7.0, v1.6.0).**
Positioning: self-hosted, block-native, REST-first jobs + resume board — a next-gen alternative to WP Job Manager-class plugins. See [`wp-career-board-pro/CAPABILITIES.md`](../wp-career-board-pro/CAPABILITIES.md) for the Pro layer.

## Posting & listing jobs
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Let employers post jobs from the frontend (guest + logged-in) with preview? | YES | `job-form` 4-step wizard + `job-form-simple`; `POST/PUT /jobs` |
| Show searchable, filterable listings (grid/list/single)? | YES | `job-listings` block; `job-filters` reorderable sidebar; `GET /search` |
| Filter by type, category, location, tag, experience, salary range, board? | YES | 5 taxonomies + salary-range slider; `wcb_default_filter_order` |
| Auto-expire jobs + send deadline reminders? | YES | daily cron `wcb_check_job_expiry`, `wcb_send_deadline_reminders` |
| Pre-moderate jobs (pending → approve/reject → resubmit)? | YES | `POST /jobs/{id}/approve\|reject`; Flagged queue + report-a-job |
| Emit Google for Jobs JobPosting JSON-LD automatically? | YES·partial | `modules/seo/class-seo-module.php` (datePosted, validThrough, employmentType, hiringOrganization, baseSalary, remote `jobLocationType`) — **not validated against Rich Results; no physical `jobLocation` address block confirmed** |
| Publish a jobs RSS feed? | YES | `/jobs/feed/` with full job fields |
| Publish a job-specific XML sitemap + ping Google Indexing API / IndexNow? | NO | only RSS + Pro per-board XML feed; no daily job sitemap or indexing pings |

## Applications & candidates
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Capture applications in-plugin (not just email/URL routing)? | YES | `wcb_application` CPT; apply drawer; guest applications — **free, unlike WPJM's $79/yr addon** |
| Give employers an application management screen (statuses, notes, export)? | YES | rebuilt Edit Application screen; 5 statuses; bulk CSV export |
| Give candidates a dashboard (profile, bookmarks, applications, resume)? | YES | `candidate-dashboard` block |
| Let candidates track their own applications? | YES | dashboard applications tab (+ Pro `my-applications` block) |
| Upload a resume (PDF/DOC/DOCX) attached to an application? | YES | `POST /candidates/resume-upload`, ≤20MB |
| Bookmark jobs, companies, and resumes? | YES | `/candidates/{id}/bookmarks`, `/saved-companies`, `/saved-resumes` |
| Let any member apply without forcing a Candidate role? | YES | role-optional; `wcb_candidate_requires_role` filter |
| One-click apply with a previously saved resume? | YES·partial | PDF auto-attached on apply; a true "apply with saved resume, no re-upload" one-click path is not surfaced |

## Employers & companies
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Give employers a dashboard (my jobs, received applications, company)? | YES | `employer-dashboard`; `wcb_access_employer_dashboard` |
| Self-register employers + upload logo? | YES | `employer-registration`; `POST /employers/register`, `/logo` |
| Ban/unban employers from admin? | YES | `wcb-employers` screen; `wcb_employer_banned/unbanned` |
| Public company profiles + directory with trust signals? | YES | `company-profile`/`company-archive` (`wcb_company` CPT); trust endpoint |

## Monetization
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Charge for job posting / featured listings? | PRO | Free ships only the bridge filters (`wcb_employer_credit_balance`, `wcb_credit_purchase_url`, `wcb_credits_enabled`); Pro Credits SDK fills them |
| Sell resume-database access (gate candidate contact behind payment)? | NO | deliberate non-goal — WCB is a plugin, not a SaaS marketplace |

## Notifications & operations
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Send transactional emails (pending, approved, rejected, received, status, expiry, guest magic-link)? | YES | 9 `AbstractEmail` templates; `wcb_registered_emails` |
| Let the owner edit email bodies + test-send? | YES | Emails settings body editor (1.6.0); `POST /admin/emails/test` |
| In-app notifications panel (read/unread, mark-all, delete)? | YES | dashboard panel; `wcb_notification_created`; `wcb_notifications_log` |
| Spam-protect submission + application forms? | YES | reCAPTCHA v3 / Turnstile drivers; `wcb_pre_*_submit` gates |
| Send Zapier/webhook triggers on job/application events? | NO | no webhook layer — hooks fire in-PHP only |
| Track listing view stats? | YES | `wcb_job_views` table |

## Platform, data & compliance
| Can it… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Expose a documented REST API (headless-ready, App-Password auth)? | YES | 44 routes under `wcb/v1`; `docs/website/developer-guide/03-rest-api.md`; `GET /settings/app-config` |
| Ship block-native UI with no page builder required? | YES | 17 Interactivity-API blocks; all also shortcodes + `[wcb_widget]` |
| Migrate from WP Job Manager (+ WPJM Resumes)? | YES | `wcb migrate` CLI; `class-wpjm-importer.php` (non-destructive) |
| Import jobs from CSV/XML? | YES·partial | CSV importer present; Pro adds board XML feed import |

| Multilingual (WPML / Polylang)? | YES | documented compat |
| Run on multisite? | UNVERIFIED | no explicit multisite handling found |
| Provide WP-CLI tooling? | YES | 5 commands (`wcb`, `job`, `application`, `migrate`, `scale`) |

## Developer surface
| Can a third party… | Status | How / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Add/edit/remove job-form fields via filters? | YES | `wcb_job_form_fields` + per-step filters (the WPJM `submit_job_form_fields` equivalent) |
| Find a curated hook reference + extension cookbook? | YES | `docs/HOOKS.md`; `developer-guide/02-hooks-reference.md`, `05-extension-cookbook.md` (13 recipes) |
| Override the primary frontend templates from a theme? | NO | no `locate_template` chain for cards/listings/single — **only emails are theme-overridable**; customize via hooks |
| Extend frontend JS behavior via a documented hook API? | NO | no `@wordpress/hooks`; the `wcb:search`/`wcb:results` CustomEvent seam is undocumented |
| Register a whole add-on module cleanly? | YES | Addons boot on their own `plugins_loaded` / `init` and integrate through the Free→Pro filter contract (`ProCoordination::documented_filters()`) — the balanced surface Pro itself consumes |
| Restyle without `!important` wars? | YES | 116 `--wcb-*` tokens; buddyx dark-mode compat layer |
