# WP Career Board — Role / Permission Matrix

**Generated**: 2026-04-29
**Source**: [`audit/manifest.json`](manifest.json) (capabilities, REST permissions)

Permissions are checked through the **Abilities API** (`wp_register_ability` /
`wp_is_authorized`) — not `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )`.

Legend: **C**reate · **R**ead · **U**pdate · **D**elete · **—** no access.

## Custom plugin roles

| Role slug | Source | Granted abilities |
|---|---|---|
| `wcb_employer` | `core/class-roles.php:add_employer_role` | `wcb_post_jobs`, `wcb_manage_company`, `wcb_view_applications`, `wcb_access_employer_dashboard` |
| `wcb_candidate` | `core/class-roles.php:add_candidate_role` | `wcb_apply_jobs`, `wcb_manage_resume`, `wcb_bookmark_jobs`, `wcb_access_candidate_dashboard` |
| `wcb_board_moderator` | `core/class-roles.php:add_moderator_role` | `wcb_moderate_jobs` |

> **Note on `wcb_admin` and `wcb_user`:** These role slugs were referenced in the onboarding spec, but the codebase itself does **not** define them. The plugin uses the WordPress core `administrator` role (granted every `wcb_*` ability through `Roles::add_admin_caps`) for admin functions, and any logged-in user (including the default `subscriber` role) is treated as a generic public/"user" surface for read-only access. The roles enumerated below are the canonical ones the plugin actually creates.

## Special grants

- **Administrator** receives every `wcb_*` capability via `Roles::add_admin_caps`,
  re-applied on every `init` (idempotent), so cap drift across upgrades is prevented.
- **Self-registration** (`/employers/register`, `/candidates/register`) creates the
  corresponding role automatically — these are the only two endpoints with
  `permission_callback => '__return_true'` that *write* state.
- **AntiSpam** gates all public write endpoints through the `wcb_pre_job_submit`
  and `wcb_pre_application_submit` filters — token failures short-circuit before
  the permission_callback would even run for unauth flows.
